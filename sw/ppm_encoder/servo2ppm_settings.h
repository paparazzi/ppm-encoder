/*
When signal is lost 1= ppm waveform remain on with failsafe values, 0= ppm waveform is off
For use with Paparazzi use "0", the autopilot has it's own failsafe values when PPM signal is lost.
The above failsafe values will kick in only if the servo inputs are lost which cannot happen with
a receiver with dsp processing that provides "hold" or "failsafe" features.
If the receiver only provides "hold" on the last good servo signals received  it is not suitable
for use with the Paparazzi autopilot as it will prohibit the autopilot entering the "AUTO2" or "HOME" mode.
If you use a receiver with failsafe ability then remember to set the failsafe value of the receiver
to 2000 microseconds for the "MODE" channel so the autopilot can go to "AUTO2" or "HOME" mode when the receiver
loose the tx signal. The servo signals on receivers like PCM, IPD and any receiver with servo hold AND failsafe
will not stop outputing servo pulses thus the encoder will never stop producing a PPM pulse train
except if the throttle channel is used as an indication by setting the "RC_LOST_CHANNEL" to a value above 0.
If you use the throttle channel as an indication that the TX signal is lost then:
RC_USE_FAILSAFE set to 0 means that the ppm output will be shut down and if you set
RC_USE_FAILSAFE  to 1 the ppm output will NOT shut down but it will now output the failsafe values
defined above.

/*
The channel number (1,2,3...7,8) that will be used as a receiver ready indicator.
If set above 0 then this channel should be always connected otherwise
the PPM output will not be enabled as the ppm encoder will wait for ever for this channel
to produce a valid servo pulse.
If 0 then the first connected channel going from channel 1 to 8 will be used, in other words
which ever connected channel comes on first it will indicate that the receiver is operational.
The detection of all connected channels is independent of this setting, this channel
is used as an indication that the receiver is up and running only.

/*
The default value for the rc signal lost indicator channel and it's threshold value in microseconds .
If the value is above 1500 microseconds then when the signal lost indicator channel servo pulse exceeds
RC_LOST_THRESHOLD then the ppm output will be shut down.
If the value is below 1500 microseconds then when the signal lost indicator channel servo pulse gets lower than
RC_LOST_THRESHOLD then the ppm output will be shut down.
If the RC_USE_FAILSAFE is set to 1 then the ppm output will not stop producing pulses but now
the ppm wavetrain will contain the failsafe values defined in the beginning of this file.
The RC_LOST_CHANNEL must be a value from 1 to 8.
0 = the function is disabled. BE CAREFULL, 0 IS A VERY DANGEROUS OPTION !!!

The below settings are good for almost every situation and probably you don't need to change them.
Be carefull because you can cause a lot of problems if you change anything without knowing
exactly what you are doing.
